👷 This website is still under construction, but should be ready by the end of November! 👷

I'm a PhD Candidate at Georgia Tech and an intern at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. At Sandia, I work on the [Structural Simulation Toolkit](http://sst-simulator.org/), a collection of architectural simulation components and interfaces. I also work on high-level performance modeling on the [AGILE](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/agile) project.

My thesis topic is _Multifidelity Computer Architecture Simulation_. This work started with my paper [Online model swapping for computer architecture simulation](/publication/model-swapping). 

I am also the creator of the [Spatter memory benchmark](https://github.com/hpcgarage/spatter). This tool lets users explore the performance of a large class of gather/scatter-based memory access patterns on CPUs and GPUs. Spatter will be used during the design of ATS-5, the successor to [Crossroads](https://discover.lanl.gov/news/1020-supercomputer-tycho).
