I am a Senior Member of Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories in the Scalable Computer Architecture group. I work on the [Structural Simulation Toolkit](http://sst-simulator.org/), a collection of architectural simulation components and interfaces. I also work on high-level performance modeling on the [AGILE](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/agile) project.

I am a developer of the [Spatter memory benchmark](https://github.com/hpcgarage/spatter). This tool lets users explore the performance of a large class of gather/scatter-based memory access patterns on CPUs and GPUs. Spatter will be used during the design of ATS-5, the successor to [Crossroads](https://discover.lanl.gov/news/1020-supercomputer-tycho).
