As computer systems grow larger and more complex, it takes more
time to simulate their behavior in detail. Researchers interested in
simulating large-scale systems must choose between less-accurate
high-level models or simulating smaller portions of their benchmark suite, both of which are highly manual, offline approaches
that require time-consuming analysis by experts. Multifidelity simulation aims to lessen this burden by automatically adapting the
fidelity of a simulation to the complexity of the behavior occurring
at any given point in time. We show how a multifidelity memory
system model can be used to accelerate single node simulation by
up to 2x with 1-5% mean absolute percent error in the simulated
instructions per cycle across benchmark suites.
