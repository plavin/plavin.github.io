= Peach Mead 1 =

I'm combining the "Non-Boiling Method" from HomeBrewStuff.com's recipes and the peach mead recipe from this page [[https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/2hneem/cherry_and_spiced_peach_melomels_recipe_inside/]].

1. Clean and sanitize all equipment
2. Add 3lb honey and 2lb chopped peaches to fermenter
3. Add hot water to 1 gal mark
4. Add Fermax Yeast nutrient and 1 crushed campden tablet
5. Cover with dry airlock for 24 hours
6. Pitch yeast
7. After 1 week, add fermaid k and fermax in recommended amounts
